# RaySMR

Simple yet pretty bouncing ball simulation program written in C using [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib).

## Credits

- The visuals are heavily inspired from Youtube channels like [@jdgcreative](https://www.youtube.com/@jdgcreative).
- [Tsoding](https://github.com/tsoding) for inspiring me to try some low-level stuff in C.


## Building

Should be pretty straight-forward on UNIX systems. Make sure you have raylib installed from your distribution's package manager and take a look in `build.sh`.
